## Fixes Applied After Review:

### Spacing and Layout Issues Fixed:
1. **Login/Register Cards**: 
   - Added `max-w-md mx-auto` to prevent cards from stretching full width
   - Cards now have proper centered layout with constrained width

2. **Element Spacing**:
   - Added proper margins between terminal cards (`margin-bottom: 1rem`)
   - Fixed spacing between challenge items with `mb-4`
   - Adjusted system status and terminal output sections with `mb-6`
   - Added `mt-3` to flag submission inputs for better separation

3. **Input Fields**:
   - Added `w-full` class to all input fields in login/register forms
   - Limited flag input width with `max-w-md` to prevent over-stretching
   - Fixed alignment of $ prompt symbols with inputs

4. **ASCII Art**:
   - Added `overflow-x-auto` to ASCII art to handle smaller screens
   - Ensured proper rendering on mobile devices

## Result:
The UI has been completely redesigned with a classic terminal aesthetic that looks modern but not futuristic. The design emphasizes:
- Clean, minimalist terminal interface with proper spacing
- High contrast green-on-black color scheme
- Authentic terminal feel with ASCII art and command prompts
- Modern usability with responsive design
- Consistent terminal metaphor throughout all pages
- Fixed layout issues with proper card widths and element spacing
